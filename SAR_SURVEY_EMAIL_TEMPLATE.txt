---

Hi [Team Name/SAR Community Member],

I hope you're doing well. I'm reaching out because we're building something critical for Search & Rescue teams like yours—a unified platform that brings case management, real-time coordination, and resource tracking into one integrated system.

**We need your help.**

Over the next 27 days (through December 31, 2025), we're gathering feedback from SAR professionals, volunteers, coordinators, and emergency management leaders to understand your operational challenges and priorities.

## What We're Asking

A brief, 10-15 minute survey covering:
- Your team's biggest operational challenges
- Tools you're already using (and what's missing)
- Features that would make the biggest impact
- Whether you'd pilot the platform with us

**Time to complete**: 10-15 minutes  
**Deadline**: December 31, 2025 (Midnight)  
**Confidential**: Your individual responses stay private; we only report aggregated feedback

We're building this platform **for you and with you.**
