# SAR Platform Stakeholder Survey
## Gathering Requirements for Unified Search & Rescue Operations Software

**To**: SAR Directors, Coordinators, K9 Handlers, Divers, Drone Pilots, Marine Teams, Land Search Leaders  
**From**: CESAROPS Development Team  
**Date**: November 26, 2025  
**Purpose**: Design a unified, modular SAR platform that scales from small internal cases to major incident command operations

---

## INTRODUCTION

We're building a single integrated platform to replace the fragmented tools SAR teams currently use (separate case management, mapping, radio logging, resource tracking, compliance systems). The goal: **one system that works for everyone, everywhere, modular for your discipline, robust enough for multi-agency crisis coordination.**

This survey asks about your current workflow, pain points, and requirements. Your honest feedback will shape what we build.
